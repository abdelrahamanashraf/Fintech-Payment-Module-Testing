3- Testing Strategy 

    The testing strategy will employ a layered approach, combining manual and automated testing techniques

    3.1 Manual Testing 

    Techniques:
    * Exploratory Testing: To uncover unexpected issues and usability problems
    * Scenario-Based Testing: Simulate real-world user scenarios
    * Usability Testing: Evaluate the user experience and ease of use
    * Security Testing (Manual): Validate specific security aspects, such as session management and manual validation of authorization
       
        
    Areas of Focus:
    * User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) testing
    * Complex payment scenarios involving multiple currencies and payment methods
    * Edge cases and boundary conditions
    * Manual verification of security and compliance requirements
    * Manual verification of authorization and authentication flows

    3.2 Automated Testing 

        Techniques: 
        
    * Unit Testing: To verify the functionality of individual components and functions. 
    * API Testing: To validate the functionality and performance of APIs 
    * Integration Testing: To verify the interaction between different modules and external systems.
    * End-to-End (E2E) Testing: To simulate complete user workflows across the entire system 
    * Regression Testing: To ensure that new changes do not introduce regressions into existing functionality.
    * Security Testing (Automated): Static and dynamic code analysis, vulnerability scanning 
        
        
        Areas of Focus:
        
        * Core payment processing logic
        * API functionality and performance
        * Integration with payment gateways and currency exchange APIs
        * Critical user workflows (e.g., payment, refund)
        * Regression testing of existing functionality
        * Automated authentication and authorization tests

4 Test Coverage 

    4.1 Functional Testing:
        * Positive Cases: Successful payment, refund, and currency conversion scenarios.
         * Negative Cases: Invalid input, insufficient funds, expired cards, API errors, and other failure scenarios.
         * Boundary Value Analysis: Testing at the limits of input values.
         * Equivalence Partitioning: Dividing input data into valid and invalid partitions.  
         
         
         
    4.2  Intergration Testing : 
        * Verification of data flow between the Payment Processing Module and external APIs
         * Testing the interaction between the web, mobile, and backend systems
         * Validation of data consistency across different systems
     
    4.3  End to End Testing : 

        * Making a payment with different payment methods and currencies
        * Processing a full and partial refund
        * Performing a currency conversion before payment
        * User registration and login flow

    4.4 Secuirty Testing 

        * Authentication and authorization testing
        * Data encryption and secure storage
        * Input validation 
        * Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
        * Session Management testing
    
    4.5 Authentication and Authorization Flows: 
            
            4.5.1 
                 Authentication:
                 
                 * Valid user login with correct credentials
                 * Invalid user login with incorrect credentials
                 * Password reset functionality
                 * Multi Factor Authentication
                 * Session time out
                 
            4.5.2 
              Authorization : 
                * Access to payment processing functions based on user roles
                * Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data
                * Testing for privilege escalation

5 Test Enviroment 
         
        * Test data that simulates real-world scenarios
        * Access to necessary APIs and external systems
        * Secure test accounts with varying roles and permissions
        

6 Test Data
